    <h3>WARNING!</h3>
    Sound support in mozilla is a work in progress. mozmp is only compatible
    with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/">mozilla 0.8.1</a>.

    There is also a problem with some .wav's. Mozilla is not able to play
    all .wav's. What .wav's will and will not work are still not known. This
    is something that is still being looked into.
